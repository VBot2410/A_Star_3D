\subsection*{Overview}

A$\ast$ is a widely used algorithm for pathfinding in 2-\/D environments. This project takes the planning algorithm one step further and applies it to a 3-\/\+Dimensional environment.~\newline
 This project\textquotesingle{}s objective is to buid a planning module for Aerial Vehicles. Provided with the world boundary and Obstacle location data, the module provides the optimal path from start point to the goal by avoiding all obstacles.~\newline
 Development of this project follows {\bfseries Solo Iterative Process (S\+IP)} model in Software Engineering.~\newline
 Tested on Ubuntu 16.\+04 L\+TS with G\+CC 5.\+4.\+0.

\subsection*{Description}

The World boundary and obstacle data is provided in the (xmin,ymin,zmin,xmax,ymax,zmax) format. The module then uses this data along with the robot dimensions information to discretize the world and build a 3-\/D Configurtion Space. This C-\/\+Space is used to plan the Robot\textquotesingle{}s path using A$\ast$ Search. \paragraph*{A$\ast$ Search Algorithm}

A$\ast$ is an algorithm that searches for lowest cost path among all possible paths from start to goal. What A$\ast$ algorithm does is that at each step it picks the node from open list according to the value {\itshape f}, which is sum of two other parameters {\itshape g} and {\itshape h}. ~\newline
 Here, {\itshape g} value of a node is the cost to move from start to that node and {\itshape h} value is the estimated movement cost to move from that given node to the final destination.\+There are many ways to calculate {\itshape h} and this project provides an option to select between {\bfseries Euclidean Distance} and {\bfseries Manhattan Distance}.~\newline
 Obstacle nodes have the cost of infinity to travel through them and hence, the planner avoids these nodes in path planning.~\newline
 Typical implementations of A$\ast$ use a priority queue to perform the repeated selection of minimum (estimated) cost nodes to expand. This priority queue is known as the open list. At each step of the algorithm, the node with the lowest {\itshape f(x)} value is removed from the queue, the {\itshape f} and {\itshape g} values of its neighbors are updated accordingly, and these neighbors are added to the queue. The algorithm continues until a goal node has a lower {\itshape f} value than any node in the queue (or until the queue is empty). The {\itshape f} value of the goal is then the length of the shortest path, since {\itshape h} at the goal is zero in an admissible heuristic.
